# Description
I decided to create a 2D game in Unity. I've worked in Unity before but as a designer, so I haven't done much scripting before. The goal was to get better at C# and JavaScript, and to also see what 2D game-making is like (previously only worked in 3D realm).

# What I Learned
* I recently got a new laptop and forgot how long it takes for Unity to download (so I should start earlier) 
* serialization in Unity is super helpful for user testing (I had a friend play the game and the speed was way too fast) 

# What Didn't Work
* I tried implementing some shooting ability but ran into a couple of errors/difficulty in shooting down parts of the line collider without getting rid of the whole hexagon. 
* I'm curious on how to add one's own art work/a sprite as the moving hexagon instead of a crude line collider and how this could enhance my ability to add a player shooter to the game.
